## Questions to be resolved
- Scenario: two people are working in separate branches on separate files, call them contributor 1, working in file a, and contributor 2 working in file b.  Contributor #1 finishes their edit in file A and merges their branch into the main branch.  A day later contributor #2 finishes their edit and goes to merge their branch with the main.  But their branch has an old version of file A.  So when they go to merge - I assume a merge conflict will arise?  Is this true, or how does git / github protect against overwriting and other issues that will arise in this scenario
- How do you work with local databases that will differ in terms of access / data from other people?
- How do you protect credentials when using github.  For example database login information being used in code?
